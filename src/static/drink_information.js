      name: 'Kentucky Mule',
      history: "This drink is a variation of the popular 'Moscow Mule'. The story goes that a failing vodka peddler, John G. Martin, collaborated with a bar owner who was also struggling to sell his homemade ginger beer supply. Meanwhile, a third friend of theirs had another failed business venture and an oversupply of copper mugs. The outcome of what they threw together was the Moscow mule. Martin used the recently invented Polaroid camera to take pictures of guests drinking the Moscow Mule, and the campaign is credited with solidifying Vodka as a staple spirit in the U.S. The Kentucky Mule replaces the vodka with bourbon.",

However the name was changed in a recipe book printed 16 years late.  In 1874 there was a common joke in New York and other places around the country that involved telling someone that a man named Tom Collins was saying bad things about them.  They would start the conversation asking, “Have you seen Tom Collins?” and go on to tell the person that he was in a nearby bar or other business talking badly about them.  The goal was to upset that person enough that they would go looking for this fictional man.  The joke gained notoriety and became known as the Tom Collins Hoax of 1874.  The first Tom Collins recipe was printed in the 1876 book The Bartenders’ Guide by Jerry Thomas, who is known as the father of American mixology.',
